# wasmCloud Application Deployment Manager (wadm)

The wasmCloud Application Deployment Manager (**wadm**) enables declarative wasmCloud applications. It's responsible for managing a set of application deployment specifications, monitoring the current state of an entire [lattice](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/reference/lattice/), and issuing the appropriate lattice control commands required to close the gap between observed and desired state. It is currently in an `alpha` release state and undergoing further rigor and testing approaching a production-ready version.

## Using wadm

### Install

Ensure you have a proper [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) toolchain installed.

```
cargo install wash-cli --git https://github.com/wasmcloud/wash --branch feat/wadm_0.4_support --force
cargo install wadm --git https://github.com/wasmcloud/wadm --version v0.4.0-alpha.1 --force
```

You can deploy **wadm** by downloading the binary for your host operating system and architecture, and then running it alongside your wasmCloud host. We recommend using **wash** to run wasmCloud and NATS, and then running **wadm** afterwards connected to the same NATS connection.

### Setup

```
wash up -d   # Start NATS and wasmCloud in the background
wadm         # Start wadm
```

### Deploying an application

Take the following manifest and save it locally (you can also download this from [echo.yaml](./oam/echo.yaml)):

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: echo
  annotations:
    version: v0.0.1
    description: "wasmCloud echo Example"
spec:
  components:
    - name: echo
      type: actor
      properties:
        image: wasmcloud.azurecr.io/echo:0.3.5
      traits:
        - type: spreadscaler
          properties:
            replicas: 1
        - type: linkdef
          properties:
            target: httpserver
            values:
              ADDRESS: 127.0.0.1:8080

    - name: httpserver
      type: capability
      properties:
        image: wasmcloud.azurecr.io/httpserver:0.17.0
        contract: wasmcloud:httpserver
```

Then, use **wadm** to put the manifest and deploy it.

```
wash app put ./echo.yaml
wash app deploy echo

```

ðŸŽ‰ You've just launched your first application with **wadm**! Try `curl localhost:8080/wadm` and see the response from the [echo](https://github.com/wasmCloud/examples/tree/main/actor/echo) WebAssembly module.

When you're done, you can use **wadm** to undeploy the application.

```
wash app undeploy echo
```

### Modifying applications

**wadm** supports upgrading applications by `put`ting new versions of manifests and then `deploy`ing them. Try changing the manifest you created above by updating the number of echo replicas.

```yaml
  name: echo
  annotations:
    version: v0.0.2 # Note the changed version
    description: "wasmCloud echo Example"
spec:
  components:
    - name: echo
      type: actor
      properties:
        image: wasmcloud.azurecr.io/echo:0.3.5
      traits:
        - type: spreadscaler
          properties:
            replicas: 10 # Let's run 10!
```

Then, simply deploy the new version:

```
wash app put ./echo.yaml
wash app deploy echo v0.0.2
```

If you navigate to the [wasmCloud dashboard](http://localhost:4000/), you'll see that you now have 10 instances of the echo actor.

_Documentation for configuring the spreadscaler to spread actors and providers across multiple hosts in a lattice is forthcoming._

## Responsibilities

**wadm** has a very small set of responsibilities, which actually contributes to its power.

- **Manage Application Specifications** - Manage models consisting of _desired state_. This includes the creation and deletion and _rollback_ of models to previous versions. Application specifications are defined using the [Open Application Model](https://oam.dev/). For more information on wadm's specific OAM features, see our [OAM README](./oam/README.md).
- **Observe State** - Monitor wasmCloud [CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io/) from all hosts in a lattice to build the current state.
- **Take Compensating Actions** - When indicated, issue commands to the lattice control interface to bring about the changes necessary to make the desired and observed state match.

## API

Interacting with **wadm** is done over NATS on the root topic `wadm.api.{prefix}` where `prefix` is the lattice namespace prefix. For more information on this API, please consult the [wadm Reference](https://wasmcloud.dev/reference/wadm).

## ðŸš§ Advanced

In advanced use cases, **wadm** is also capable of:

- Monitoring multiple lattices
- Running multiple replicas to distribute load among multiple processes, or for a high-availability architecture.

ðŸš§ The above functionality is somewhat tested, but not as rigorously as a single instance monitoring a single lattice. Proceed with caution while we do further testing.
