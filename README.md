# wasmCloud Application Deployment Manager (wadm)

The wasmCloud Application Deployment Manager (**wadm**) enables declarative wasmCloud applications.
It's responsible for managing a set of application deployment specifications, monitoring the current
state of an entire [lattice](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/deployment/lattice/), and issuing the
appropriate lattice control commands required to close the gap between observed and desired state.

## Using wadm

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=401352358&machine=standardLinux32gb&location=EastUs)

### Install & Run

You can easily run **wadm** by downloading the [`wash`](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/installation) CLI, which automatically launches wadm alongside NATS and a wasmCloud host when you run `wash up`. You can use `wash` to query, create, and deploy applications.

```
wash up -d    # Start NATS, wasmCloud, and wadm in the background
```

Follow the [wasmCloud quickstart](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/tour/hello-world) to get started building and deploying an application, or follow the **Deploying an application** example below to simply try a deploy.

If you prefer to run **wadm** separately and/or connect to running wasmCloud hosts, you can instead opt for using the latest GitHub release artifact and executing the binary. Simply replace the latest version, your operating system, and architecture below. Please note that wadm requires a wasmCloud host version >=0.63.0

```
# Install wadm
curl -fLO https://github.com/wasmCloud/wadm/releases/download/<version>/wadm-<version>-<os>-<arch>.tar.gz
tar -xvf wadm-<version>-<os>-<arch>.tar.gz
cd wadm-<version>-<os>-<arch>
./wadm
```

### Deploying an application

Take the following manifest and save it locally (you can also download this from
[echo.yaml](./oam/echo.yaml)):

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: echo
  annotations:
    description: "This is my app"
spec:
  components:
    - name: echo
      type: component
      properties:
        image: wasmcloud.azurecr.io/echo:0.3.7
      traits:
        - type: spreadscaler
          properties:
            instances: 1

    - name: httpserver
      type: capability
      properties:
        contract: wasmcloud:httpserver
        image: wasmcloud.azurecr.io/httpserver:0.17.0
      traits:
        - type: spreadscaler
          properties:
            instances: 1
        - type: link
          properties:
            target: echo
            namespace: wasi
            package: http
            interfaces:
              - incoming-handler
            source_config:
              - name: default-port
                properties:
                  address: 0.0.0.0:8080
```

Then, use **wadm** to put the manifest and deploy it.

```
wash app put ./echo.yaml
wash app deploy echo
```

ðŸŽ‰ You've just launched your first application with **wadm**! Try `curl localhost:8080/wadm` and see
the response from the [echo](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/tree/main/examples/golang/components/http-echo-tinygo) WebAssembly component.

When you're done, you can use **wadm** to undeploy the application.

```
wash app undeploy echo
```

### Modifying applications

**wadm** supports upgrading applications by `put`ting new versions of manifests and then `deploy`ing
them. Try changing the manifest you created above by updating the number of echo instances.

```yaml
<<ELIDED>>
spec:
  components:
    - name: echo
      type: component
      properties:
        image: wasmcloud.azurecr.io/echo:0.3.7
      traits:
        - type: spreadscaler
          properties:
            instances: 10 # Let's run 10!
<<ELIDED>>
```

Then, simply deploy the new version:

```
wash app put ./echo.yaml
wash app deploy echo v0.0.2
```

If you run `wash ui` and navigate to the [wasmCloud dashboard](http://localhost:3030/), you'll see that you now have
10 instances of the echo component.

_Documentation for configuring the spreadscaler to spread components and providers across multiple hosts
in a lattice is forthcoming._

## Responsibilities

**wadm** has a very small set of responsibilities, which actually contributes to its power.

- **Manage Application Specifications** - Manage models consisting of _desired state_. This includes
  the creation and deletion and _rollback_ of models to previous versions. Application
  specifications are defined using the [Open Application Model](https://oam.dev/). For more
  information on wadm's specific OAM features, see our [OAM README](./oam/README.md).
- **Observe State** - Monitor wasmCloud [CloudEvents](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/reference/cloud-event-list) from all hosts in a lattice to build the current state.
- **Take Compensating Actions** - When indicated, issue commands to the [lattice control
  interface](https://github.com/wasmCloud/interfaces/tree/main/lattice-control) to bring about the
  changes necessary to make the desired and observed state match.

## ðŸš§ Advanced

In advanced use cases, **wadm** is also capable of:

- Monitoring multiple lattices.
- Running multiple instances to distribute load among multiple processes, or for a high-availability
  architecture.

ðŸš§ The above functionality is somewhat tested, but not as rigorously as a single instance monitoring
a single lattice. Proceed with caution while we do further testing.

### API

Interacting with **wadm** is done over NATS on the root topic `wadm.api.{prefix}` where `prefix` is
the lattice namespace prefix. For more information on this API, please consult the [wadm
Reference](https://wasmcloud.dev/reference/wadm).

## Known Issues/Missing functionality

As this is a new project there are some things we know are missing or buggy. A non-exhaustive list
of these can be found below:

- It is _technically_ possible as things stand right now for a race condition with manifests when a
  manifest is updated/created and deleted simultaneously. In this case, one of the operations will
  win and you will end up with a manifest that still exists after you delete it or a manifest that
  does not exist after you create it. This is a very unlikely scenario as only one person or process
  is interacting with a specific, but it is possible. If this becomes a problem for you, please let
  us know and we will consider additional ways of how we can address it.
- Manifest validation is implemented, but slightly clunky. Any PRs that make this better would be
  more than welcome!

controller RFC](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-otp/issues/177) and then was reworked in
version `0.4` in response to [the tidying and productioning
