# wadm devcontainer

A simple devcontainer that has `rust` installed. Try it out with `devcontainer open` at the root of this repository!

As a `postCreateCommand`, we run an install script that grabs an alpha released version of `wadm` for you and installs a compatible (currently unreleased) version of `wash` for you to get started with.

## Prerequisites

- [devcontainer CLI](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/devcontainer-cli#_installation)
- VSCode
