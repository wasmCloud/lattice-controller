# wadm Open Application Model

The wasmCloud Application Deployment Manager uses the [Open Application Model](https://oam.dev) to define application specifications. Because this specification is extensible and _platform agnostic_, it makes for an ideal way to represent applications with metadata specific to wasmCloud.

## wasmCloud OAM Components

The following is a list of the `component`s wasmCloud has added to the model.

- `actor` - An actor
- `provider` - A capability provider

## wasmCloud OAM Traits

The following is a list of the `traits` wasmCloud has added via customization to its application model.

- `spreadscaler` - Defines the spread of instances of a particular entity across multiple hosts with affinity requirements
- `linkdef` - A link definition that describes a link between an actor and a capability provider

## Example Application YAML

The following is an example YAML file describing an ALC application

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1beta1
kind: Application

  name: my-example-app
  annotations:
    version: v0.0.1
    description: "This is my app"
